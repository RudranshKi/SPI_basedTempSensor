# __SPI-based Mixed-Signal Modelling Temperature Sensor__

This is a Verilog implementation of a temperature sensor that uses a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to communicate with a control logic.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Features <br>
   - 10-bit temperature resolution <br>
   - SPI communication protocol    <br>
   - 2 &ordm; temperature resolution <br>

Tools used-

    Icarus Verilog
    GTKWave
    Terminal
    VIM
