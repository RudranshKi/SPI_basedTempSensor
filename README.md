Mixed Signal Modelling Temperature Sensor with SPI Interface

This is a Verilog implementation of a mixed signal modelling temperature sensor. The sensor design is purely digital and features an SPI interface for communication. The design has been implemented and tested on an FPGA board.
Overview

The temperature sensor design is a mixed-signal model with both digital and analog components. The analog part of the design includes a thermistor that converts temperature into a resistance value. This analog signal is then digitized using an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), which provides a digital output value. The digital part of the design includes an SPI interface that allows communication between the sensor and a host controller.

The Verilog implementation of the temperature sensor includes the following components:

    SPI controller: A digital SPI controller that interfaces with the host controller and provides control signals to the ADC and temperature sensor.
    ADC: A digital ADC that converts the analog output of the temperature sensor into a digital value that can be read by the SPI controller.
    Temperature sensor: An analog temperature sensor that converts temperature into a resistance value that is read by the ADC.

Implementation

The Verilog implementation has been tested on an FPGA board. The code can be synthesized and implemented on any FPGA board that supports the SPI protocol.

The code is divided into three main modules:

    SPI_controller: This module implements the SPI controller that interfaces with the host controller and provides control signals to the ADC and temperature sensor.
    ADC: This module implements the digital ADC that converts the analog output of the temperature sensor into a digital value that can be read by the SPI controller.
    Temperature_sensor: This module implements the analog temperature sensor that converts temperature into a resistance value that is read by the ADC.

Usage

The Verilog code can be downloaded from the repository and synthesized using any Verilog compiler. Once synthesized, the code can be uploaded to an FPGA board that supports the SPI protocol. The sensor can then be tested by connecting it to a host controller and reading the temperature values.
Conclusion

The mixed signal modelling temperature sensor implemented in Verilog provides a low-cost and efficient solution for temperature sensing applications. The SPI interface allows easy communication with a host controller, and the digital design provides accurate temperature measurements. The design can be easily modified and adapted to suit different temperature sensing applications.
