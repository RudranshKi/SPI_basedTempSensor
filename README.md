# __SPI-based Mixed-Signal Modelling Temperature Sensor__

This is a Verilog implementation of a temperature sensor that uses a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to communicate with a control logic.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Features <br>
   - 10-bit temperature resolution <br>
   - SPI communication protocol    <br>
   - 2 &ordm; temperature resolution <br>

Tools used-

    Icarus Verilog
    GTKWave
    Terminal
    VIM

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd repository

Run the Verilog simulation environment:

bash

verilog -gui temperature_sensor_tb.v temperature_sensor.v

Follow the simulation instructions to test the temperature sensor.
