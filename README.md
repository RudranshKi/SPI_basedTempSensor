SPI-based Mixed-Signal Modelling Temperature Sensor

This is a Verilog implementation of a temperature sensor that uses a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to communicate with a microcontroller. The design is purely digital and is modeled to provide accurate temperature readings with minimal power consumption.
Features

    10-bit temperature resolution
    SPI communication protocol
    Low power consumption
    Compact design

Dependencies

    Verilog simulation environment

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd repository

Run the Verilog simulation environment:

bash

verilog -gui temperature_sensor_tb.v temperature_sensor.v

Follow the simulation instructions to test the temperature sensor.
